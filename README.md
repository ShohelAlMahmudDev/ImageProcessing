# ImageProcessing

## Overview

The **ImageProcessing** project is a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application designed for image manipulation and processing. It leverages the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern to facilitate modular development, separation of concerns, and efficient testing.

## Features

- **Image Combining**: Merge multiple images into one with customizable options.
- **Image Manipulation**: Apply various transformations such as resizing, rotation, and cropping.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Clear separation of UI and business logic.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 5.0 or higher
- Visual Studio (or any IDE supporting .NET development)

2. Open the solution file (`FastImageCombineSolution.sln`) in Visual Studio.

3. Build and run the solution.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
